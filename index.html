    <p>Technology giant Nvidia says its sales have hit a record after more than doubling as demand for its artificial
        intelligence (AI) chips soars.

        The company says revenue jumped to above $13.5bn <b>(Â£10.6bn)</b> for the three months to the end of June.

        Nvidia also expects sales to soar further in the current quarter and plans to buy back $25bn of its stock.

        The firm's shares rose by more than 6.5% in extended trading in New York, adding to their huge gains this year.

        Nvidia also said it expects revenue of around $16bn for the three months to the end of September.

        That is much higher than Wall Street expectations and would equate to a rise of around 170%, compared to the
        same time last year.</p>
