    <p>Space is hard, as the saying goes.

        As humans have endeavored to launch themselves and their machines beyond Earth, that maxim has been proven again
        and again. Recent attempts to touch down on the moon — a feat first accomplished nearly 60 years ago by the
        former Soviet Union’s robotic Luna-9 probe — have been particularly fraught with failure.

        But on August 23, an Indian spacecraft, for the first time, successfully landed on the surface of the moon. The
        Chandrayaan-3 mission, which launched July 14, delivered the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover to the south
        pole of the moon, a region thought to contain water ice (SN: 5/24/22).

        Such reservoirs of water ice would provide a crucial source of not only drinking water for any future lunar
        inhabitants but also hydrogen for fuel. This was the country’s second attempt at a lunar landing, following the
        crash of Chandrayaan-2’s lander in 2019 (SN: 9/20/19).

        Vikram’s landing catapults India into a rarefied group of nations that have successfully made a “soft landing” —
        as opposed to an uncontrolled “hard landing” — on the moon: the United States, the former Soviet Union and China
        (SN: 12/16/19). The success of the mission, however, follows close on the heels of recent failures.</p>
