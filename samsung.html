            <p>More Ways to Personalize Your Experience
                One UI 6 is loaded with great new ways for users to customize the Galaxy experience based on their own
                habits and preferences, so it feels even more like an extension of themselves. For instance, it is now
                possible to set different lock screens according to specific Modes and Routines, such as a calming photo
                of a forest in Sleep Mode. There is also a new custom camera widget, which lets users preselect a camera
                mode and a storage location – like portrait mode and a folder just for headshots.</p>
